# AI Inference Microservice – Requirements Specification

## 1. Overview
The **AI Inference Microservice** performs asynchronous inference on images retrieved from an external service called **media_store**.

### Key Characteristics
- **Clients do NOT upload images.**  
  They provide a **`media_store_id`**, and this service fetches the image via media_store API (stub for now).
- The service performs (stubbed) inference:
  - Image Embedding  
  - Face Detection  
  - Face Embedding
- Job execution is **asynchronous**, using a **persistent SQLite-backed queue**.
- Results are uploaded **back to media_store** under the same `media_store_id`.  
  *(The endpoint is stubbed for now; real endpoint will replace later.)*
- Jobs store metadata in SQLite until explicitly removed.
- Upon completion, the service **broadcasts a job completion event**.
- Clients **do not poll**; they query results **only after receiving the broadcast**.
- A cleanup API is provided to purge jobs, queue entries, and temporary files.

## 2. Workflow Summary

1. Client calls:
   ```
   POST /job/{task_type}
   ```
   with:
   ```json
   { "media_store_id": "<id>" }
   ```

2. The service fetches the source image from media_store using a *stub endpoint*:
   ```
   GET /media_store/get/{media_store_id}
   ```

3. The job is inserted into:
   - `jobs` table (SQLite)
   - SQLite persistent queue

4. Background worker:
   - Dequeues the job  
   - Fetches the image  
   - Performs inference (stub)  
   - Prepares results (embeddings, detected faces, or face embeddings)  
   - Posts results back to media_store:
     ```
     POST /media_store/post_results/{media_store_id}
     ```
   - Stores result metadata in SQLite until deletion

5. When done, worker broadcasts:
   ```json
   { "event": "job_completed", "job_id": "<job_id>", "status": "completed" }
   ```

6. Client receives the broadcast event and then calls:
   ```
   GET /job/{id}
   ```

7. Client calls:
   ```
   DELETE /job/{id}
   ```
   This removes job metadata, queue entries, and temporary result files.

## 3. Supported Tasks

### 3.1 Image Embedding
- Fetch image from media_store  
- Generate embedding (stub)  
- Upload embedding result to media_store  
- Store metadata in SQLite until deletion

### 3.2 Face Detection
- Detect bounding boxes and landmarks (stub)  
- Upload face metadata & face crops to media_store  
- Store metadata in SQLite until deletion

### 3.3 Face Embedding
- Detect faces  
- Generate embeddings for each face  
- Upload embeddings + face crops to media_store  
- Store metadata in SQLite until deletion

---

## 4. SQLite Storage

### 4.1 Database Tables
- `jobs`  
- `queue`  
- `face_detection_results`  
- `embeddings`  
- `face_embeddings`  
- `media_store_sync_status`

### 4.2 File Storage
Temporary artifacts stored until deletion:
```
/data/job/{job_id}/embedding.bin
/data/job/{job_id}/faces/{i}.jpg
/data/job/{job_id}/faces/{i}.bin
```

---

## 5. Queue Requirements
- Persistent SQLite-backed queue  
- Survives crashes and restarts  
- FIFO ordering  
- Duplicate prevention  
- Supports multiple workers safely  

---

## 6. Broadcasting
Broadcast emitted when job completes:
```json
{
  "event": "job_completed",
  "job_id": "<id>",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

Broadcast implementations (pluggable):
- MQTT  
- SSE  
- Webhooks (future)

Clients do **not** poll until the event is received.

---

## 7. Media Store Integration

### 7.1 Fetch Image (Stub)
```
GET /media_store/get/{media_store_id}
```

### 7.2 Post Results (Stub)
```
POST /media_store/post_results/{media_store_id}
```

Uploads:
- Embeddings  
- Face crops  
- Face metadata  
- Face embedding metadata  

---

## 8. API Specification

### 8.1 POST /job/{task_type}
Creates a job with provided `media_store_id`.

### 8.2 GET /job/{id}
Client retrieves result metadata only after receiving the broadcast.

### 8.3 DELETE /job/{id}
Removes all metadata and temporary files.

### 8.4 DELETE /admin/cleanup
Supports filters:
- `older_than_seconds`
- `status=pending/completed/all`
- `remove_results`
- `remove_queue`
- `remove_orphaned_files`

---

## 9. Failure Handling
- Missing media_store image → job marked `error`  
- Failed result upload → retry with exponential backoff  
- Persistent sync failure → status = `sync_failed`  

---

## 10. Non-Functional Requirements
- SQLite must be ACID-safe  
- Multi-worker safe queue  
- Logging excludes raw images  
- Round numeric output values  
- File handling optimized for embedded/edge devices (RPi-compatible)
